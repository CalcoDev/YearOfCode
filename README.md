# Year Of Code

Inspired by [Carter Semrad's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr8biZfSZ3Y).

A website where I plan to showcase different coding projects in a more organised / funky way.

## DISCLAIMER:

The project uses Astro, however, as a small challange for myself, I decided to use only vanilla JS with no framework. **THERE IS NO REAL ARGUMENTED REASON FOR THIS**
